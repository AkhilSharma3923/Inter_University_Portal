              The Government of Jharkhand is committed to promoting innovation and excellence in education. In line with this vision, we are developing an online integrated platform where all universities/colleges in Jharkhand can provide information about the projects done by their students. This platform will be a great resource for students, researchers, and industry professionals alike.

            <p>
              The platform will have a number of features, including: <br>
              * A searchable database of student projects from all universities/colleges in Jharkhand. <br>
              * The ability for students to upload their projects to the platform and share them with others. <br>
              * Tools for plagiarism detection and prevention. <br>
              * Forums for students to discuss their projects and collaborate with others. <br>
            </p>
      
            <p>
              We believe that this platform will play a significant role in promoting innovation and excellence in education in Jharkhand. By providing students with a platform to share their work and collaborate with others, we are helping them to develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the 21st century.
